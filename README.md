![integration tests](https://github.com/leftindust/leftindust-backend/actions/workflows/integration-tests.yml/badge.svg)

This is a project containing all microservices within the backend, its structured as a gradle project, although not 
everything is JVM based (such as Gladio). 

you can find details on individual services by reading the README in the module root 

this is currently UNSTABLE, tests do NOT run, and the federated data graphql is subject to change. Over the coming week
I will be transitioning all actions to this repository and eventually containerizing the entire backend.
